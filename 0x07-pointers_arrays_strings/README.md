# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during **ALX  Software Engineering Scholarship** at **ALX Students Educationton**. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
